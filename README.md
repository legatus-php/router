## Installation
You can install the Router component using [Composer][composer]:

```bash
composer require legatus/router
```

## Quick Start

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

use Legatus\Http\Router;
use Legatus\Http\RoutingContext;
use Legatus\Http\RoutingContextError;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Resp;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Req;
use function Legatus\Http\handle_func;

/**
 * @param Req $req
 * @return Resp
 * @throws RoutingContextError
 */
function show_user(Req $req): Resp {
    $id = RoutingContext::of($req)->getParam('id');
    return new Nyholm\Psr7\Response(200, [], 'Hello User ' . $id);
}

$router = new Router();
$router->get('/users/:id', handle_func('show_user'));

$request = new Nyholm\Psr7\ServerRequest('GET', '/users/1');
$response = $router->handle($request);

echo $response->getBody() . PHP_EOL; // Hello User 1
```

# Project status & release process

While this library is still under development, it is well tested and should be stable enough to use in production environments.

The current releases are numbered 0.x.y. When a non-breaking change is introduced (adding new methods, optimizing existing code, etc.), y is incremented.

When a breaking change is introduced, a new 0.x version cycle is always started.

It is therefore safe to lock your project to a given release cycle, such as 0.2.*.

If you need to upgrade to a newer release cycle, check the [release history][releases] for a list of changes introduced by each further 0.x.0 version.
